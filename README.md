# Bast Cloud Controller

This is the code for the Bast Cloud Controller.

The controller is composed of two Microservices.

The microservice in the admin directory handles requests from the app to change settinsgs and manage their access control systems.

The microservice in the access directory handles requests from controllers to authenticate users when they present their cards at a door.
